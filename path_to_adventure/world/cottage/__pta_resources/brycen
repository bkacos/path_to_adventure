This is your home. You live here. It is a ugly mushrooom in a 
magical land of mystery and adventure. You hear the call of adventure ... uh
... calling you. Get ready for your adventure.

> To start, CREATE A TEXT FILE here called "name.txt" with your name in it. 
  Bonus points if you can do it without using a text editor like nano.

> During your adventures, you will encounter treasure. Find all the treasure and 
  bring it back here. You'll need somewhere to put your treasure, though, so 
  CREATE A DIRECTORY named "treasure_chest" right here in your ugly mushroom.

  When you find a file with "treasure" in its name, you must MOVE it to your 
  "treasure_chest" directory. Make sure to CAT it first, because there are some 
  false treasures out there.

> Now explore the path that lies before you. Use the commands "cd", "ls", and "pwd"
  among others to navigate this world of adventure. Start by leaving home by typing
  "cd .." at the prompt. This will take you to the world that contains your little cottage
  
> Each time you enter a new location, check to see if there is a README with "ls", and if 
  there is a README, you should read it with "cat README"

> Unless you are playing in HARD MODE, you can ask for help by typing "p2a-help"
